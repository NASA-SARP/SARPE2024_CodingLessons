This is a repository of lessons taught to the NASA Student Airborne Reserach Program (SARP) East 2024 interns. These lessons are based off of material on the SARP programming website (https://nasa-sarp.github.io/sarp_lessons).

These lessons were designed to teach necessary computer programming skills for earth science research. Each lesson is designed to be 45 to 90 minutes in length. These lessons were taught sequentially over a 3 week period. Some lessons have practice problems with answers attached. 

The focus of these lessons is to build a ground-up understanding of how to work with real earth data in common data structures in Python.The lessons begin with discussing data types, lists, and dictionaries before diving  deeper into working with tabular data with the pandas library and gridded data in the xarray library. Other programming skills such as reading errors, debugging code, reading documentation, visualization, and how to communicate your code are integrated throughout the lessons.

Please utilize any and all material to further computer programming education in earth science researchers!
